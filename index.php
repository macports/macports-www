    <h2 class="hdr">The MacPorts Project Official Homepage</h2>

    <p>The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing,
    and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/">Mac
    operating system</a>. To that end we provide the command-line driven MacPorts software package under a <a
    href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">3-Clause BSD License</a>, and through it easy access to thousands of ports
    that <a href="<?php print $guide_url . '#introduction'; ?>"> greatly simplify</a> the task of <a href="<?php print $guide_url
    . '#using'; ?>">compiling and installing</a> open-source software on your Mac.</p>

    <p>We provide a single software tree that attempts to track the latest release of every software title (port) we distribute,
    without splitting them into &#8220;stable&#8221; Vs. &#8220;unstable&#8221; branches, targeting mainly macOS High Sierra v10.13 and later
    (including macOS Big Sur v11).
    There are <a href="<?php print $portdb_url; ?>">
    <b>thousands</b> of ports</a> in our tree, distributed among different categories, and more are being added on a regular basis.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>A good way for students to get involved is through the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>. GSoC is a program to encourage students' participation in Open Source development and offers a stipend to work on the project with an organization for three months. MacPorts has been participating in the program since 2007! We shall participate next year as well. You may find <a href="<?php print $trac_url . 'wiki/SummerOfCodeArchive'; ?>">past GSoC projects here</a>.</p>

<!-- Comment GSoC participation for now
            <p>We are looking for students to join us in making <?php print date('Y'); ?> the best Summer of Code yet. Applicants will be paired with The MacPorts Project mentors to guide them through the coding tasks. This is a great opportunity to gain exposure to real-world software development scenarios. You don't have to be a proven developer, we'd like to have students who are committed to helping MacPorts. </p>

            <p> We have a list of ideas with possible tasks for MacPorts and additional information about the process at <a href="<?php print $trac_url . 'wiki/SummerOfCode'; ?>">wiki/SummerOfCode</a>. We are always open to new ideas. Research on the idea, draft an initial proposal and get it reviewed. </p>
