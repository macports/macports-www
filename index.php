    <h2 class="hdr">The MacPorts Project Official Homepage</h2>

    <p>The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing,
    and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/">Mac
    operating system</a>. To that end we provide the command-line driven MacPorts software package under a <a
    href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD 3-Clause License</a>, and through it easy access to thousands of ports
    that <a href="<?php print $guide_url . '#introduction'; ?>"> greatly simplify</a> the task of <a href="<?php print $guide_url
    . '#using'; ?>">compiling and installing</a> open-source software on your Mac.</p>
    
    <p>We provide a single software tree that attempts to track the latest release of every software title (port) we distribute,
    without splitting them into &#8220;stable&#8221; Vs. &#8220;unstable&#8221; branches, targeting mainly OS X Mavericks v10.9 and later
    (including macOS Sierra v10.12).
    There are currently <a href="ports.php">
    <b><?php print $portsdb_info['num_ports']; ?></b> ports</a> in our tree, distributed among <?php print $portsdb_info['num_categories']; ?>
    different categories, and more are being added on a regular basis.</p>
